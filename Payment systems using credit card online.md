How to prevent credit card fraud in online transaction:

- Don't use a public wifi or network. Use your own modem and mobile data to ensure the security.

- As the first and easiest way, check the website familiarity and review with your search engine. 

- Pay attention to the address bar. Even though the website address starts with http:/ (without S) it doesn't always mea that website is not secure and scam. But to be on the safe side, YOU SHOULD NEVER ENTER PERSONAL INFORMATION INTO A SITE BEGINNING WITH HTTP://

- Check for the green padlock. This padlock will turn green if SSL certificate is intsalled. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https  protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser. typically, SSL is used for a secure credit card transactions, data transfer and logins, and nowadays become the norm of secure browsing of social media sites.
  Notes: this green padlock doesn't state that the website is free of fraud and scam, it only means that your information will be encrypted.

- Check the website credibility through some easy to use tool. For example Google transparency report: 

  https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search

- Look if the website has another way to contact them. If it's available only through email, you should be aware of that. If the phone number is available, you should try to contact them and look if someone is answering.  Try to figure out if the person, if answering, is sounding suspicious by trying to push you or encourage you so much to put your credit card number or another important and sensitive data. 

- Try to find detailed information about the website, the owner, the country where it's registered, etc. Many scammers would launch their scams during the time when online transaction reach its peak (exmp: Holiday, Thanksgiving, black friday). So it's better to check how long has this website  is online and if they have a good credibility. You can try this website to find out about it: https://whois.domaintools.com/

- Prefer secure payment options. Choose some secure methods like PayPal or Credit Card payment. Avoid unrefundable or untraceable payment method such as wire transfer, money order, or (for now) crypto currency.

- Compare the price online and on the regular market. If you found something that the price is unrealistically cheap compared to the real price, you should double (or triple) check it. 

- If your bank provide it, try Virtual Credit Card (VCC), gift card, or buy a prepaid card that is temporary and you can set the limit / cap for it according to your preference. Thus, it will not affect your main credit card that you need to use for higher expenses transaction. We will talk about VCC later.

- Pay attention into your credit card transaction. Download your bank application that can send you notification for each transaction. You can also choose bank or credit card provider that enable extra security measures for credit card transaction such as two-factor-authentication through SMS for transaction that reach some amount of limit. (Verification through SMS is not the most secure way nowadays but having 2FAis better than nothing).



Virtual Credit Card (Single use credit card)
  Virtual Card Payment as an alternative for digital payment. Virtual card payment is a single use "card" that is issued by bank's customer to use for a temporary online payment. Customer can ask the bank to issue a virtual credit card (VCC) and set an expiry date and limit of the card payment.Most of vendors who accept traditional credit card  will also accept VCC.

  method:

  - Use one VCC for particular payments and for particular websites. It can help you to manage your expanses also. 
  - Set the limit of the credit card so that if there was a data breach or the VCC numbers and data are leamed, it wouldn't make an astronomical bill on your credit card monthly bill.

  Pros of VCC:

  - Prevent over expanses because of credit card frauds
  - help to manage expanses on credit card by dividing one card for certain transaction good or services
  - You can easily create a limit
  - Would't affect the main credit card that might has a much higher limit of transaction
  - You won't need to deal with too many credit card physically
  
  Cons:

  - Payment that use subscription system would be interupted if the card expires
  - Available only for online transaction
  - Like having a lot of credit card, it could be a hasle if we don't know how to manage the VCC properly including overspending on stuffs online.

  In Estonia SEB provides virtual card, no physical card. When we order, we can limit our transaction up to 3500 Euro. You can apply if you're 18 years old or above and it is valid for 40 days.

  
Prepaid Card
  Another alternative is to use prepaid card. Based on personal experience, it's really flexible and I believe the safest way if you don't want transaction to be tracked. 

  Pros: 

  - Not like a give card, you can use it for more than one merchant or vendors
  - You can set the limit easily when you purchase them
  - Easy to obtain (at least in USA)
  - Not linked to your bank account information. You don't even need a bank account to use this card.
  - If we activate it with the right account and data, we could get back the card with value in it if we lost it. Some additional fees might apply.
  - It's a physical card so you can use it not only for online transaction but also offline transaction

  Cons:

  - Requires extra fees to activate it (around $5 in 2017)
  - You can not reuse it. The amount in the card is what is paid upon the card purchase and top up option is not available.
  - Wasting too many plastics which is not good for the environment.
  - You can't withdraw the money from the ATM
  - Some cards won't work for a subscription services with recurring bill
